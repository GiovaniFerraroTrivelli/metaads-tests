First install dependencies
```
npm install
```

Then resolve each test, each test has a description.md file with the problem description. 
You have to write you solution in the index.js file of each test folder.
You can run the test with each of the following commands:
```
npm run test-1
npm run test-2
npm run test-3
```

You can also run all the tests with
```
npm run test
```

All of these commands run on watch mode, so you can edit the code and the test will run again.
